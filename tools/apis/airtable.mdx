Airtable integration in Wildcard provides comprehensive management of bases, tables, records, and comments, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete data across your Airtable workspace.

## Authentication

Airtable requires OAuth2 with PKCE authentication. Here are all available scopes:

| Scope | Description | Access Level |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `data.records:read` | See the data in records | Read only |
| `data.records:write` | Create, edit, and delete records | Read/Write |
| `data.recordComments:read` | See comments in records | Read only |
| `data.recordComments:write` | Create, edit, and delete record comments | Read/Write |
| `schema.bases:read` | See the structure of a base, like table names or field types | Read only |
| `schema.bases:write` | Edit the structure of a base, like adding new fields or tables | Read/Write |

Follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. Follow our [OAuth2 setup guide](/authentication/oauth2) to configure Airtable authentication
2. Register the OAuth2 credentials with your client
