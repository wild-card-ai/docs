## Adding Individual Tools

Add specific tools to your client. This loads the tool's schema and makes it available for use:

```python
from wildcard_openai import WildcardClient
from wildcard_core.models import Action

client = WildcardClient(api_key="your_wildcard_api_key")

# Add specific Airtable operations you need
client.add_tool(Action.Airtable.LIST_RECORDS)
client.add_tool(Action.Airtable.CREATE_RECORD)
```

## Adding All Tools from an API

Load all available tools from a specific API service. This gives your client access to every endpoint in that API:

```python
client = WildcardClient(api_key="your_wildcard_api_key")

# Add all Airtable operations (list, create, update, delete records, etc.)
client.add_tool_by_api(APIService.AIRTABLE)
```

## Running Tools

Once a tool is added, you can execute it with arguments:

```python
args = {
    "base_id": "appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "table_name": "Projects"
}
response = await client.run_tool_with_args(
    tool_name=Action.Airtable.LIST_RECORDS,
    **args
)
```

## Tool Formats

When you add tools, Wildcard loads their schemas and converts them to formats that LLMs can understand.
<Note>
The Wildcard format is a prompt optimized format that is easy to understand for LLMs.
</Note>

```python
from wildcard_openai.WildcardClient import ToolFormat

# Get tools in OpenAI format - converts to OpenAI function schema
openai_tools = client.get_tools(format=ToolFormat.OPENAI)

# Get tools in Wildcard format - native schema format
wildcard_tools = client.get_tools(format=ToolFormat.WILDCARD)
```
