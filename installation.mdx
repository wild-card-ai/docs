## Prerequisites

Before installing Wildcard, make sure you have:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A Wildcard API key (get one from [our dashboard](https://dashboard.wildcard.com))

## Installation Methods

### Using pip

The recommended way to install Wildcard is through pip:

```bash
pip install wildcard-openai
```

### Using poetry

If you're using Poetry for dependency management:

```bash
poetry add wildcard-openai
```

## Verify Installation

You can verify your installation by running:

```python
from wildcard_openai import WildcardClient

client = WildcardClient(api_key='your_api_key', index_name='your_index_name')
print(f"Wildcard client initialized successfully")
```

## Environment Setup

We recommend using environment variables for sensitive information like API keys. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
WILDCARD_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # If using OpenAI models
```

Then in your Python code:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = WildcardClient(
    api_key=os.getenv('WILDCARD_API_KEY')
)
```
