## Motivations

We faced the same problem many others building agents do: enabling our agents to interact with tools is painful and imprecise. Shoehorning APIs to play nicely with LLMs and then getting multiple API calls to execute successfully in a row is a painful trial and error process.

We identified that APIs are designed for developers and not LLM contexts. Each developer building integrations for AI agents writes boilerplate, experiments with system prompts, optimizes tool definitions, and parses responses into vector stores - all for the same APIs.

So we implemented `agents.json`, a way to formally prescribe a set of API actions to an agent with the tools to make APIs work for LLMs. We built this for us and we’d love to share it with you, too.

## Why is agents.json built on OpenAPI? 

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is the gold standard for describing how API endpoints work and can be executed. Most API providers have OpenAPI specs or have APIs that can be described fully by OpenAPI. These specs alone aren't sufficient for the age of AI agents, but provide great groundwork for API agent communication.

## The agents.json File

We're introducing `agents.json` - a json schema of structured contracts designed for AI agents. API providers use their existing OpenAPI spec to construct this file and agents inspect this file to run accurate series of API calls. 

Agents.json contains a set of enhancements to the OpenAPI spec - optimizing for endpoint discovery and LLM argument generation. These can include updating descriptions and adding examples.

Describing endpoints/data models without describing ***how*** they interact together is why AI agents struggle to take the right sequence of actions.

To solve this, we introduce flows and links. Flows are contracts with a series of 1 or more API calls that describe an outcome. Links describe how two actions are stitched together.

We propose the file placed in `/.well-known/agents.json` so it is easily discoverable by agents accessing web services. For now, we compose a GitHub repository as a registry for available `agents.json` files.

## The agents.json Executor

The executor enables LLMs to load, parse, and run agents.json. Here's how it works:

1. A developer connects their agent with an agents.json file.
2. The relevant chain(s) are chosen by the agent and arguments populated for a given task.
3. The executor runs the chain(s).

The goal experience is a developer adds an agents.json file in their workflow and the correct set of actions for an integration is executed. The executor supports adding Basic, ApiKey, and Bearer authentication to requests.

## Design Tenets

1. **Build on top of the OpenAPI standard**
   Leverage existing standards and infrastructure where possible.

2. **Prioritize open source**
   Maintain trust, observability, and customizability.

3. **Optimize schema for LLMs, not humans**
   Design with AI consumption in mind.

4. **Enforce Statelessness**
   Orchestration is handled by the calling agent.

5. **Require minimal changes to existing APIs**
   Make adoption as seamless as possible.

## Why Now?

With OpenAI's release of Operator, we've seen a paradigm shift in what AI will automate. Letting AI run free on the internet will ask for both features and guardrails to be built on web experiences for agents. Yet, for the majority of services - this is exactly the functionality APIs already provide - and more. 

Rather than just optimizing UXs for web agents - enriching APIs will create more scalable, powerful, and safe agents. APIs are supported by backend infrastructure built for scale. 

There are still open questions and more to be done. Starting the discussion now and building iteratively gives us a place to adapt alongside evolving paradigms in AI agent development.

## FAQs

### Shouldn't API providers provide their own agent servers or "/agent" endpoints?

We can begin building agents.json files immediately before official adoption by providers. No extra infrastructure changes, servers, or new endpoints. By putting responsibility of execution on the client - the paradigm abides by the same security and orchestration protocol of existing API based applications today. API providers can still choose to maintain official agents.json files.

### Why route to an SDK instead of making HTTP requests directly?

Although OpenAPI specs offer great descriptions of how to use APIs, code-gen with tools like OpenAPI generator and Swagger code-gen isn't perfect. Many APIs have edge cases that are accounted for in client SDKs and not in raw HTTP requests. For example, Gmail's RFC2822 format or Twilio's custom TwiML format are better parsed by code rather than generated as input by an LLM. We include copies of OpenAPI specs beside agents.json files in the repo for use.

### How is this different than the Model Context Protocol?

While MCP is designed to be stateful—relying on persistent connections between clients and servers for exchanging context and requests—Agents.json is stateless. Here, the agent independently manages all context. You can leverage your existing agent architecture and RAG systems to handle state effectively. Agents.json lets you build with existing pub/sub architectures, server-less environments, and infrastructure APIs already support today. And definitions are strongly typed by OpenAPI specs.

### What about llms.txt?

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) is a great standard for making website content more readable to LLMs, but it doesn't address the challenges of **taking structured actions**. While llms.txt helps LLMs retrieve and interpret information, agents.json enables them to execute multi-step workflows reliably.

### Why use OpenAPI?

OpenAPI is a thoughtful standard that has evolved with the changes of HTTP APIs. It is the gold standard for describing how API endpoints work and can be executed. Most API providers have OpenAPI specs or have APIs that can be described fully by OpenAPI. These specs aren't quite sufficient for the age of agents, but do provide great groundwork for API agent communication.
