1. A developer connects their agent with an `agents.json` file.
2. The relevant chain(s) are chosen by the agent and arguments populated for a given task.
3. Bridge runs the chain(s).

The goal experience is a developer adds an `agents.json` file in their workflow and the correct set of actions for an integration is executed. Bridge supports adding Basic, ApiKey, and Bearer authentication to requests.
