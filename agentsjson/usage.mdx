Hey folks,

It's encouraging to see what's laid out in the AX blog post is similar to many of the concepts within the Wildcard `agents.json` Specification. The use case targeted by `agents.json` is to enable AI-agent based consumption of APIs in an interoperable yet deterministic and accurate manner.

Formal Specification: https://agents-json.com

Happy to have a conversation to see how the `agents.json` initiative can help out.
