title: 'Wildcard Base Client'
description: 'Core client class for interacting with the Wildcard API'
---

The `WildcardBaseClient` is the foundation of Wildcard's functionality. It provides core methods for API authentication, tool management, and execution.

## When to Use WildcardBaseClient

You'll want to use `WildcardBaseClient` when:
- Building a custom integration with Wildcard that needs direct API access
- Implementing your own framework-specific client
- Requiring fine-grained control over authentication and tool execution
- Developing advanced workflows that need low-level API access

For most standard use cases, you should use one of our framework-specific clients instead (e.g. [OpenAI](/openai/overview)). The base client is primarily intended as a foundation for building higher-level abstractions.

## Key Properties

- `api_key`: Your Wildcard API key for authentication with our service
- `auth_configs`: Dictionary mapping APIService to AuthConfig for managing multiple API authentications
- `webhook_url`: URL for handling OAuth callbacks when integrating with OAuth-based services
- `index_name`: Name of the API index being used for endpoint discovery
- `logger`: Logger implementation for tracking operations and debugging

## Core Methods

### Authentication Management

The client provides methods for managing API authentication. You can associate credentials with a specific API service.

```python
async def register_api_auth(
    self,
    api_id: APIService,
    auth_config: AuthConfig
) -> None:
    """Register authentication configuration for an API."""
```

### Tool Management

These methods help you discover and understand available API endpoints:

```python
async def get_action_schema(
    self,
    action_id: str,
    collection_name: str = None
) -> APISchema:
    """Get the schema for a specific action/tool."""

async def search_endpoints(
    self,
    req: SearchEndpointsRequest
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Search for endpoints matching a query."""
```

### Tool Execution

The core method for executing API calls with proper error handling and response processing:

```python
async def run_tool_with_args(
    self,
    tool_name: ActionType,
    schema: Optional[APISchema] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> ProcessedResponse:
    """Execute a tool with the provided arguments."""
```

## Authentication Status

Before executing tools, you can verify authentication status to ensure proper setup:

```python
auth_status, schema = await client.get_auth_status("gmail_messages_send")
if auth_status.auth_required:
    print(f"Authentication required: {auth_status.message}")
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about the [Action Class](/core/action-class) for understanding tool definitions
- Explore [Supported APIs](/core/supported-apis) to see available integrations
- Implement [Custom Logging](/core/custom-logging) for better debugging and monitoring
