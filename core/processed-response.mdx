description: "Understanding Wildcard's response format and handling"
---

The `ProcessedResponse` is Wildcard's standardized format for tool execution results. It provides a consistent way to handle responses from different APIs and includes support for various data types, attachments, and metadata.

## Response Structure

```python
class ProcessedResponse(BaseModel):
    response: Any
    """The original response from the tool"""
    
    processed_response: ProcessedResponseData
    """The processed response from the tool"""

class ProcessedResponseData(BaseModel):
    data: Any
    """The main response data from the API"""
    
    documents: Optional[List[dict]] = None
    """Associated files, attachments, or additional context"""
```

## Response Types

### Standard Data Response

Basic response with just data:

```python
{
    "data": {
        "id": "123",
        "name": "Example",
        "status": "success"
    }
}
```

### Response with Documents

Response including attachments or files:

```python
{
    "data": {
        "message_id": "msg_123",
        "subject": "Document Attached"
    },
    "documents": [
        {
            "type": "attachment",
            "name": "report.pdf",
            "content": "base64_encoded_content...",
            "mime_type": "application/pdf"
        },
        {
            "type": "image",
            "name": "chart.png",
            "url": "https://example.com/chart.png",
            "mime_type": "image/png"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Response with Metadata

Response with additional context:

```python
{
    "data": {
        "results": ["item1", "item2"]
    },
    "metadata": {
        "total_count": 100,
        "page": 1,
        "has_more": true,
        "next_cursor": "next_page_token"
    }
}
```

## Working with Responses

### Basic Response Handling

```python
from wildcard_core.client import WildcardClient
from wildcard_core.models.Action import Action

async def handle_response():
    client = WildcardClient(api_key="your_api_key")
    
    response = await client.run_tool_with_args(
        tool_name=Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_GET,
        id="msg_123"
    )
    
    # Access the main data
    message_data = response.processed_response.data
    print(f"Subject: {message_data['subject']}")
    
    # Check for attachments
    if response.processed_response.documents:
        for doc in response.processed_response.documents:
            print(f"Attachment: {doc['name']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Check for Errors**: Check the error field before processing data
2. **Handle Pagination**: Use metadata for proper pagination handling
3. **Document Management**: Process documents based on their type and content
4. **Type Safety**: Use type hints and pydantic models for better code safety
5. **Memory Management**: Be careful with large document content in memory
