## Overview

When working with OAuth2 APIs, you'll need to handle cases where credentials are either missing or have expired. Wildcard provides built-in mechanisms to handle these scenarios gracefully.

## Types of Authentication Errors

There are two main types of authentication errors you might encounter:

1. **Missing Credentials** (`AuthRequiredError`): Occurs when no authentication configuration exists for an API.
2. **Expired/Invalid Credentials** (`OAuthCredentialsRequiredException`): Occurs when OAuth credentials are expired or invalid.

## Handling Missing Credentials

When no authentication configuration exists for an API, you'll receive an `AuthRequiredError`

<Note>
**Common Pitfall:** You need to have called `register_api_auth` before running the tool.
</Note>

```python
from wildcard_core.auth.auth_helper import AuthRequiredError

try:
    response = await wildcard_client.run_tool_with_args(tool_name, **args)
except AuthRequiredError as e:
    # No authentication configuration exists
    print(f"Authentication required: {e.message}")
```

## Handling Expired Credentials

When OAuth credentials are expired or invalid, you'll receive an `OAuthCredentialsRequiredException` containing information needed to refresh the token

```python
from wildcard_core.auth.oauth_helper import OAuthCredentialsRequiredException

try:
    response = await wildcard_client.run_tool_with_args(tool_name, **args)
except OAuthCredentialsRequiredException as e:
    # Get OAuth info from the exception
    oauth_info = e.oauth_info
    resume_info = e.resume_info

    # Refresh the token
    await wildcard_client.refresh_token(
        api_service=oauth_info.api_service,
        webhook_url="your_webhook_url"
    )

    # Resume the original tool execution
    response = await wildcard_client.resume_tool(resume_info)
```

## Understanding the Exception Data

The `OAuthCredentialsRequiredException` contains two important pieces of information:

1. `oauth_info`: Contains details about the OAuth requirements
```python
class OAuthCredentialsRequiredInfo:
    api_service: APIService      # The API service that needs authentication
    flows: List[OAuth2Flows]     # Available OAuth flows
    required_scopes: Set[str]    # Required OAuth scopes
```

2. `resume_info`: Contains information needed to resume the tool execution
```python
class ResumeToolExecutionInfo:
    type: str                    # Type of execution ("tool")
    tool_name: Action           # The original tool being executed
    tool_args: Dict             # Original arguments passed to the tool
    tool_schema: APISchema      # Schema of the API
```

## Resuming Tool Execution

After refreshing the token or re-authenticating, you can resume the original tool execution using the `resume_tool` method of the `WildcardClient`. This method takes the `ResumeToolExecutionInfo` object that was provided in the exception:

```python
# Resume the tool execution using the resume_info from the exception
response = await wildcard_client.resume_tool(resume_info)
```

The `resume_tool` method will:
1. Extract the original tool name, arguments, and schema from the resume info
2. Re-run the tool with the same parameters using the new authentication
3. Return the response as if the original call had succeeded

<Note>
The `resume_info` contains everything needed to retry the operation. You can store it and resume the execution later, for example after the user re-authenticates in your UI.
</Note>

Here's a complete example of handling expired credentials and resuming execution:

```python
try:
    # Original tool execution
    response = await wildcard_client.run_tool_with_args(tool_name, **args)
except OAuthCredentialsRequiredException as e:
    # Store resume info for later use if needed
    stored_resume_info = e.resume_info
    
    # Implement token refresh logic
    await refresh_token(stored_resume_info)
    
    # Resume the original execution
    response = await wildcard_client.resume_tool(stored_resume_info)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Handle Both Error Types**: Be prepared to handle both `AuthRequiredError` and `OAuthCredentialsRequiredException`.
2. **Implement Token Refresh**: Set up automatic token refresh to handle expired credentials gracefully.
3. **Store Resume Information**: If token refresh fails, store the `resume_info` to retry the operation after re-authentication.
4. **Validate Scopes**: Check if the refreshed token has all required scopes before resuming execution.
