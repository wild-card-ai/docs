## Why Wildcard?

Building AI agents that work with multiple APIs presents key challenges:
1. **Integration Compatibility**: Today's APIs were designed for databases, not for LLMs. APIs require custom wrappers, authentication handling, and custom response processing
2. **Tool Selection**: As your available tools grow beyond 5-10 functions, LLMs struggle to select the right tools for each task
3. **Scaling Complexity**: As the number of API integrations grows, so does the complexity of your agent

Wildcard solves these by providing:

- **Ready-to-use API Integrations**: Pre-built integrations with popular APIs, handling auth, and post-processing responses that fit into LLM context windows
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent patterns across all APIs, reducing development overhead
- **Intelligent Tool Selection**: Building towards automated tool selection to help agents choose the right tools (Coming Soon)

## Quick Example

```python
from wildcard_core.client import WildcardClient
from wildcard_core.models.Action import Action

async def send_email():
    # Initialize client
    client = WildcardClient(api_key="your_api_key")
    
    # Use Gmail API through Wildcard's unified interface
    response = await client.run_tool_with_args(
        tool_name=Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND,
        to="recipient@example.com",
        subject="Hello from Wildcard",
        body="Sending emails through our unified API interface!"
    )
