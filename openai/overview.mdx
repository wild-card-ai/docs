Wildcard provides seamless integration with OpenAI's models through the `WildcardClient` class. This integration allows you to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities with Wildcard's tool selection and execution system.

## Architecture Overview

</Frame>

The integration follows a structured flow:

1. **Your User Message**: The starting point - a natural language request from your user.

2. **Wildcard Integrations**: The system loads and prepares the relevant API tools based on your configuration.

3. **OpenAI Tool Calling**: OpenAI's model processes the user request and selects the appropriate tools to use.

4. **Wildcard Post-Processing**: After tool execution, Wildcard processes the API responses into a standardized format.

5. **Response Components**:
   - **Context Optimized Response**: A formatted response optimized for the LLM's context window
   - **Documents**: Any attachments or binary data from the API response

6. **Document Flow**:
   - Documents are sent to your RAG Document Store for long-term storage
   - The Context Optimized Response is sent to the LLM Context

This architecture provides several key benefits:
- Efficient tool selection and execution
- Proper handling of API responses
- Optimal context management for LLMs
- Integration with your RAG system

## Tool Formats

Wildcard supports tool formats that can be used for different purposes in your application.

### OpenAI Format

The OpenAI format converts tools into OpenAI's function schema format, which is required for function calling capabilities:

The OpenAI format is used when you need a tool to be used in the tools array of an OpenAI completion.
```python
tool_name = Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND
await client.get_tool(tool_name, format=ToolFormat.OPENAI)
```

### Wildcard Format
The Wildcard format is an enriched version of the tool defintion.
```python
tool_name = Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND
await client.get_tool(tool_name, format=ToolFormat.WILDCARD)
```

### Wildcard Prompt

The Wildcard Prompt is used when you need to describe available tools to the LLM. This improves the LLM's ability to understand the tools and use them effectively.
```python
tool_name = Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND
prompt = await client.get_tool_prompt(tool_name=Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND)
system_prompt = {"role": "system", "content": prompt}
```

## Response Processing
<Note>
See [Processed Response](/core/processed-response) for schema details.
</Note>

Integrations includes built-in response processing that:
- Formats API responses for optimal context
- Extracts and manages documents
- Provides structured data for your RAG system
- Handles large responses


## Example Usage

Here's a complete example showing the architecture in action:

```python
from wildcard_openai import WildcardClient
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from wildcard_core.models import APIService
from wildcard_openai.WildcardClient import ToolFormat
from wildcard_core.client import ProcessedResponse, ProcessedResponseData   

async def run(user_message: str):
    # Initialize clients
    wildcard = WildcardClient(
        api_key="your_wildcard_api_key",
        index_name="your_index_name"
    )
    openai = AsyncOpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key")

    # 1. Configure API integrations - see Authentication docs
    wildcard.register_api_auth(
        APIService.GMAIL,
        {"client_id": "...", "client_secret": "..."}
    )

    # 2. Add tools to the client
    wildcard.add_tool_by_api_service(APIService.GMAIL)

    # 3. Get tools in OpenAI format
    tools = [wildcard.get_tool(Action.Gmail.MESSAGES_SEND, format=ToolFormat.OPENAI)]

    # 4. Run OpenAI completion with tool calling
    completion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_message
        }],
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto"
    )

    # 5. Execute tool calls and process response
    result: ProcessedResponse = await wildcard.run_tools(completion)

    # 6. Access different response components
    context: ProcessedResponseData = result.processed_response.data  # Context optimized response
    documents = result.processed_response.documents  # Any documents/attachments

    return context, documents
```
